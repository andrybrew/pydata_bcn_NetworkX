        "NetworkX uses a __dictionary of dictionaries__ based **Adjacency List** format which is fast and ligthweight for sparse graphs. This approach is inspired on Guido van Rossum's essay [Python Patterns - Implementing Graphs](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/) and in the work of David Eppstein on [Python Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/).\n",

        "\n",
        "* **n in G** to test if the graph $G$ contains node $n$\n",
        "* **for n in G** to loop over all nodes\n",
        "* **G[n]** to access all neighbors of $n$ in $G$\n",
        "* **len(G)** to get the number of nodes in $G$\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally the node $n$ is a key in the $G.adj$ dictionary, values are themselves dictionaries with neighbors as keys and another dictionary as value that holds edge attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "So NetworkX graphs are \"dictionaries all the way down\". This is not exactly true in version 2.0 but it is safe for users to think of it this way. "
